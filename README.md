# Student Marks Prediction

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict student final scores based on various factors. It was developed using Linear Regression in Python and includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

## Features
- **Study Time**: Hours spent studying.
- **Playtime**: Hours spent on leisure activities.
- **Attendance**: Percentage of classes attended.
- **Sleep Hours**: Hours of sleep per day.
- **Previous Marks**: Scores from prior exams.
- **Screentime**: Hours spent on screens.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset (`student_marks_prediction.csv`) contains synthetic or real student data used for training and testing the model.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/supriyo-1207/student-marks-prediction.git`
2. Open the notebook (`student_marks_prediction.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3. Upload the `student_marks_prediction.csv` file.
4. Run all cells to train the model and visualize results.
